# 🌳 Tree Species Classification using Deep Learning

This project classifies tree species based on images of leaves or bark using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a custom dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a web application built with *Streamlit* that allows users to:
- Upload an image of a tree's *leaf or bark*
- Get a prediction of the *tree species*
- View model's *top predictions and confidence levels*

---

## 🧠 Model Info

- Model: improved_cnn_model.h5
- Architecture: Initially custom CNN, later improved using *MobileNetV2* (transfer learning)
- Input size: 224x224 pixels
- Number of classes: 31 tree species

## 📁 Dataset

- Custom dataset with 31 classes
- Organized in the following folder format:
- ## 🔗 Model Download

The model is too large to upload directly to GitHub. It will be downloaded from Google Drive when the app starts.
